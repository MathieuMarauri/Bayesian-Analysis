This repo contains code and articles on how to perform bayesian data analysis and modelling. Documentation (blog posts, articles, ...) are given in the [doc](https://github.com/MathieuMarauri/Bayesian-Analysis/tree/master/doc) folder, articles are writen in the [markdown](https://github.com/MathieuMarauri/Bayesian-Analysis/tree/master/markdown) folder and code is provided in the [src](https://github.com/MathieuMarauri/Bayesian-Analysis/tree/master/src) folder. 

The following subjects are adressed: 

* Hypothesis testing TODO
* Linear regression model TODO
* Logistic regression model TODO
* Naive Bayes model TODO
* Bayesian decision tree TODO
* Computation TODO

Each section should contain example code easy to reproduce and also theoritical explanations.
